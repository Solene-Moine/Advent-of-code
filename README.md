day 1-4 : easy. But code still ugly

day 5 : The parsing was really hard! It took me at least an hour and half, and the solution I found is terrible, I was just desperate to have results. Once the parsing is done following the instruction is rather simple. I'm going to try to improve this one when I have the time.

day 6 : This one was honestly really easy. I just took some time to find how to make sure a character was unique in a string. For the second part I just had to replace 4 by 14 so it was only a matter of seconds.

day 7 : I didn't manage to do this one yet. I hope I'll be able to do it later, I think I should try with trees.

day 8 : Nothing particularly difficult here, I changed a lot my code between the first and second part, it's not pretty yet.

day 9 : It's the first time I used classes, I should have done this earlier, it's really handy. I was lucky that my code for the first part was easily adaptable for the second part by updating each following node as if it was the tail of the previous one. But I think I can do better. I'll modify later.

day 10 : This one was fun, not really hard. I especially liked the second part. The first was really easy.

day 11 : I resolved the first part without parsing, only by writing by hand the input, because I was more interested to get immediatly to the heart of the problem. I'm having fun with classes. It took me a long time, but only because I made small mistakes that were hard to track, I got the reasonning down pretty quickly. I'll do the parsing later! Probably.
I didn't understand at all what was asked in the second part ! So I did a quick search on google to see what we were supposed to do. But I didn't take any code.

day 12 : I used the BFS algorithm for the first part. It's the first one which took me more than 4 hours to code. But it's because I spent the first 3 on a different approach. I learned a lot today

day 13 : I spent a lot of time on it but it doesn't work yet because I'm having trouble with returning boolean with recursive functions.

day 14 : It took a while. I had trouble with stopping the loop inside the class when the sand was overflowing, so in the end I just put the loop outside of the class. Not the best solution but it works. Considering the first part was done, the second didn't take too long. But I didn't realize immediatly that the size of my matrix was actually creating walls, so I had to make it big enough with trial and error. 

day 17 : It reminds me of day 14 but this time instead of sand falling it's rocks. I haven't tried yet.

day 20 : It took an hour for it to excecute the first part. The second part isn't feasible that way. I have to completely rewrite it.
