# Advent-of-code

Repository made for the advent of code 2022 and training with the advent of code 2020

day 1-4 : easy. But code still ugly

day 5 : The parsing was really hard! It took me at least an hour and half, and the solution I found is terrible, I was just desperate to have results. Once the parsing is done following the instruction is rather simple. I'm going to try to improve this one when I have the time.

day 6 : This one was honestly really easy. I just took some time to find how to make sure a character was unique in a string. For the second part I just had to replace 4 by 14 so it was only a matter of seconds.

day 7 : I didn't manage to do this one yet. I hope I'll be able to do it later, I think I should try with trees.

day 8 : Nothing particularly difficult here, I changed a lot my code between the first and second part, it's not pretty yet.

day 9 : It's the first time I used classes, I should have done this earlier, it's really handy. I was lucky that my code for the first part was easily adaptable for the second part by updating each following node as if it was the tail of the previous one. But I think I can do better. I'll modify later.

day 10 : This one was fun, not really hard. I especially liked the second part. The first was really easy.

day 11 : I resolved the first part without parsing, only by writing by hand the input, because I was more interested to get immediatly to the heart of the problem. I'm having fun with classes. It took me a long time, but only because I made small mistakes that were hard to track, I got the reasonning down pretty quickly. I'll do the parsing later! Probably.
I didn't understand at all what was asked in the second part ! So I did a quick search on google to see what we were supposed to do. But I didn't steal any code.

day 12 : I used the BFS algorithm for the first part. It's the first one which took me more than 4 hours to code. But it's because I spent the first 3 on a different approach. I learned a lot today
